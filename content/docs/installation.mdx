## Build from Source

# Or build with the UI embedded
make build-all
```

The binary will be created at `./bin/resolvx`.

## Docker

Run ResolvX in a Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name resolvx \
  -p 53:53/udp \
  -p 53:53/tcp \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v resolvx-data:/var/lib/resolvx \
