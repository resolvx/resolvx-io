# Quick Start

This guide will help you get ResolvX running and serving DNS queries in just a few minutes.

## Step 1: Download and Install

```bash
# Download the latest release
curl -LO https://github.com/resolvx/resolvx/releases/latest/download/resolvx-linux-amd64
mv resolvx-linux-amd64 resolvx
chmod +x resolvx

# Grant required capabilities
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ./resolvx
```

## Step 2: Start the Server

```bash
./resolvx server
```

You should see output like:

```
INFO DNS server listening on :53
INFO API server listening on :8080
INFO NATS embedded server started
INFO Ready to serve queries
```

## Step 3: Access the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the ResolvX dashboard.

## Step 4: Create Your First Zone

Using the API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/zones \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "example.com"}'
```

Or use the dashboard to create a zone through the UI.

## Step 5: Add DNS Records

Add an A record:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/zones/example.com/records \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "www",
    "type": "A",
    "value": "192.168.1.100",
    "ttl": 300
  }'
```

## Step 6: Test DNS Resolution

Query your new record:

```bash
dig @localhost www.example.com

# Expected output:
# www.example.com.    300    IN    A    192.168.1.100
```

## Using the CLI

ResolvX also includes CLI commands for management:

```bash
# List zones
./resolvx zone list

# Create a zone
./resolvx zone create example.com

# Add a record
./resolvx record create example.com www A 192.168.1.100 --ttl 300

# List records
./resolvx record list example.com
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have ResolvX running, explore these features:

- [Create more zones](/docs/zones) - Manage your DNS zones
- [Add different record types](/docs/records) - A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, and more
- [Set up GTM policies](/docs/gtm-overview) - Global traffic management
- [Configure clustering](/docs/clustering) - High availability setup

## Common Issues

### Permission Denied on Port 53

If you see a permission error, ensure you've granted the required capabilities:

```bash
sudo setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' ./resolvx
```

Or run with sudo (not recommended for production):

```bash
sudo ./resolvx server
```

### Port Already in Use

If port 53 is already in use, you may have another DNS service running. Check with:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :53
```

Stop the conflicting service or configure ResolvX to use a different port:

```bash
./resolvx server --dns-listen :5353
```
